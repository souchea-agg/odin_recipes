                <li>1 bowl of leftover roast chicken or turkey</li>

                <li>1/2 cup gravy</li>

                <li>fresh herbs for garnish</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven according to the pizza crust package instructions. If your oven has a British accent, even better.</li>
                <li>Place your pre-made pizza crust on a baking sheet or pizza stone. </li>
                <li>Spread a generous layer of mashed potatoes on the pizza crust. Think of it as the comforting hug your pizza needs.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the shredded roast chicken or turkey over the mashed potatoes. This is where Italian and British flavors collide in a beautiful mess.</li>
                <li>Scatter your leftover roasted vegetables on top of the meat layer. The more colorful, the merrier. Embrace the chaos!</li>
                <li>Drizzle gravy over the entire pizza. Don't hold back; we're going for that "gravy river flowing through a flavor landscape" vibe.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle mozzarella cheese generously over everything. It's the glue that holds this culinary adventure together.</li>
                <li>Bake the Roast Dinner Pizza in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the crust is golden brown. This should take about 10-15 minutes, or until you start smelling delicious confusion.</li>
                <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool slightly. Garnish with fresh herbs for a touch of sophistication amidst the madness.</li>
                <li>Slice your Roast Dinner Pizza and serve. Cheers mate!</li>
