            <h3>Chicks Dig A Man With A Weiner and Meatballs</h3>
            <p>Everyone's got a history textbook in their house. Pop it open and you'll see that back hundreds of years ago, kings around the world were eating this astounding dish. Today, I reveal to you the secret that makes the magic.</p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>4 hotdog buns (because you can't just eat one)</li>
                <li>4 cooked hotdogs (or however many you can handle...)</li>
                <li>1 can of tomato sauce (because who has time for homemade when you're this daring)</li>
                <li>1 sliced jalape√±o pepper (this recipe can use a little confusion)</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded blue cheese (fancy)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin by cooking your hotdogs until they're nice and plump. This is crucial; they'll be the sturdy base for your spaghetti masterpiece.</li>
                <li>Heat up your canned spaghetti in a saucepan. Don't forget to stir occasionally, or it might start plotting against you.</li>
                <li>Once your spaghetti is warm and slightly menacing, place a generous amount on top of each hotdog. Don't worry about being neat; spaghetti is notorious for its rebellious nature.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle shredded blue cheesd on top of the spaghetti-covered hotdogs. This step is essential for achieving that "I can't believe I'm eating this, but it's strangely satisfying" taste.</li>
                <li>Serve your Spaghetti Hotdog creation to others or dog them out yourself... I know you can!</li>
            </ol>
